  The project pdf is provided. My goal with this project was to make my code as readable and concise as possible while respecting my school's formatting standard.

Type in {COLORNAME} in order to change color of the output. Multiple colors can be used in a single output. Take a look at the t_color table in the ft_printf.c file to see the color codes There are 16 which represent the 16 possible ANSI colors. Example: ft_printf("{BG}%sOHMAGERRR{P}YUCHANGE{O}%dbaloneyyy\n", "oheuheuhmcflurry", 59);

if you want to write to a file descriptor. Use ft_fprintf(fd, const *f, ...); if you want to write to a file descriptor.
