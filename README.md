printf fucking

I've included a test file. Clone this repository, and type in the command make in order to compile the printf library, as well as run the tests.

If you'd like, you can add more tests to the main.c test file. Pressing make will recompile the whole printf library as well as run the new main.c test file. 

If you don't want to wait though, then type in the command gcc main.c libftprintf.a to compile, and then ./a.out to execute
